Project Requirements From The Business:

    1. Authentication: (/users; /login; /account)

        - Users of the app are hotel employees. They need to be logged into the app to 
            perform tasks;

        - New users can only be signed up inside the applications (to guarantee that only 
            actual hotel emplyees can get accounts);

        - Users should be able to upload an avatar, and change their name and password;

    2. Cabins: (/cabins)

        - App needs a table view with all cabins, showing the cabin photo, name, capacity, 
            price and current discount;

        - Users should be able to update or delete a cabin, and to create new 
            cabins (including uploading a photo);

    3. Bookings: (/bookings)

        - App needs a table view with all bookings, showing arrival and departure dates, 
            status and paid amount, as well as cabin and guest data;

        - The booking status can be "unconfirmed" (booked but not yet checked in), 
            "checked in", or "checked out". The table should be filtrable by this status;
        
        - Other booking data includes: number of guest, numer of nights, guest observations,
            wether they booked breakfast, breakfast price;
    
    4. Check in/out: (/checkin/:bookingID)
    
        - Users should be able to delete, check in, or check out a booking as the guest
            arrives (no editing necessary for now);

        - Booking may not have been paid yet on guest arrival. Therefore, on check in,
            users need to accept payment (outside the app), and then confirm that payment
            has been recieved (inside the app);

        - On check in, the guest should have the ability to add breakfast for the 
        entire stay, is they hadn't already;

    5. Guests:

        - Guest data should contain: full name, email, national ID, nationality, and a 
            country flag for easy identification;

    6. Dashboard: (/dashboard)

        - The initial app screen should be a dashboard, to display importan infromation 
            for the last 7, 30, or 90 days:

            - A list of guests checking in and out on the current day. Users should
                be able to perform these tasks from here;

            - Statistics on recent bookings, sales, check ins, and occupancy rate;

            - A chart showing all daily hotel sales, showing both "total" sales and
                "extras" sales (only breakfast at the moment);
            
            - A chart showing statistics on stay durations, as this is an important 
                metric for the hotel;
    
    7. Settings: (/settings)
    
        - Users should be able to define a few application-wide settings: breakfast price,
            minimum and maximum nights per booking, maximum guests per booking;
        - App needs a dark mode.
    
    8. BUGFIXES:

        DONE âœ… - Edit Cabin Functionality -> a better way to close the edit cabin form;
        - Cabin Menu Modal -> close modal on menu icon click;

        To InvestigateðŸ¤” 
            - Strange behaviour of the TodayActivity displayed on the
             dashboard. Particularly the function from apiBookings used in 
             useTodayActivity hook. 
                - The getStaysTodayActivity function behaves in a pequliar manner when
                there is a date discrepancy between the local time and UTC.
                - The function queries Supabase for specific dates from starting_date
                and ending_date using a custom function getToday.
